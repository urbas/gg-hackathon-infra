# Quick start

You should get a link like this from us: http://1.1.1.1:8280/?token=91532df0b01f5a4f9d13ab8497307f65848ddea419722034

This page is called Jupyter Notebook. We'll just call it notebook. You can write and execute Python code in it, but you can also just take notes in it.

Alright, let's get started!

Can you spot the "New" button near the top-right? Click on it. A drop-down list will appear. Select "Python 3" from the list of choices.

Now you can already start writing Python code! Try typing in this:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

Then press `Ctrl+Enter` and observe the magic!

This is it. You're ready to hack-a-ton!

# Pro tips

In your notebook you can press the `p` key (whenever you're not actively editing text in the notebook). This will bring up a searchable list of all available commands in Jupyter Notebook.
